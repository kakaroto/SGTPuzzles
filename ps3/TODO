High priority :
- Add an about page
- Add man pages/Help section for each game
- Fix performance issues, need 30/60 fps on full redrawns on 1080p now it's around 1 or 2 fps...
- Add a way to enter numbers/letters for Solo/Unequal games

Medium priority :
- Add a 'resize screen' at boot (some tvs crop the left size of the screen)
- Redo a cleaner design of the user interface
- Recognize when a game is completed and show a message+play sound.
- Check if a game is solved and allow easy 'new game'

Low priority :
- the save/load thread seems to crash (get interrupted) if we do a quit from the xmb while the save/load menu is open
