Untangle
       You  are given a number of points, some of which have lines
       drawn between them. You can move the points about arbitrar‐
       ily;  your  aim  is  to position the points so that no line
       crosses another.

       I originally saw this in the form of a  Flash  game  called
       Planarity [7], written by John Tantalo.

   Untangle controls
       To move a point, click on it with the left mouse button and
       drag it into a new position.

       (All the actions described in section 2.1 are  also  avail‐
       able.)

   Untangle parameters
       There  is only one parameter available from the `Custom...'
       option on the `Type' menu:

       Number of points
              Controls the size of the puzzle, by  specifying  the
              number of points in the generated graph.
