Range
       You  have  a grid of squares; some squares contain numbers.
       Your job is to colour some of the squares black, such  that
       several criteria are satisfied:

       ·      no square with a number is coloured black.

       ·      no  two  black squares are adjacent (horizontally or
              vertically).

       ·      for any two white squares, there is a  path  between
              them using only white squares.

       ·      for  each  square with a number, that number denotes
              the number of squares  reachable  from  that  square
              going  in  each  direction until hitting a wall or a
              black square.

       For instance, a square containing the number one must  have
       four black squares as its neighbours by the last criterion;
       but then it's impossible for it to be connected to any out‐
       side white square, which violates the second to last crite‐
       rion. So no square will contain the number one.

       Credit for this puzzle goes to Nikoli, who  have  variously
       called it `Kurodoko', `Kuromasu' or `Where is Black Cells'.

   Range controls
       Click with the left button to paint a square black, or with
       the right button to mark a square with a  dot  to  indicate
       that  you are sure it should not be painted black. Repeated
       clicking with either button will cycle the  square  through
       the  three  possible  states  (filled,  dotted or empty) in
       opposite directions.

       You can also use the cursor keys to move  around  the  grid
       squares. Pressing Return does the same as clicking with the
       left button, while pressing Space does the same as a  right
       button click.

       (All  the  actions described in section 2.1 are also avail‐
       able.)
