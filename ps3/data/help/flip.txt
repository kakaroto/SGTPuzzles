Flip
       You have a grid of squares, some light and some dark.  Your
       aim  is  to  light all the squares up at the same time. You
       can choose any square and flip its state from light to dark
       or  dark to light, but when you do so, other squares around
       it change state as well.

       Each square contains a small diagram  showing  which  other
       squares change when you flip it.

   Flip controls
       This  game  can  be  played with either the keyboard or the
       mouse.

       Left-click in a  square  to  flip  it  and  its  associated
       squares,  or use the cursor keys to choose a square and the
       space bar or Enter key to flip.

       If you use the `Solve' function on this game, it will  mark
       some  of  the  squares  in  red. If you click once in every
       square with a red mark, the game should be solved. (If  you
       click  in  a  square  without  a  red mark, a red mark will
       appear in it to indicate that you will need to reverse that
       operation to reach the solution.)

       (All  the  actions described in section 2.1 are also avail‚Äê
       able.)

   Flip parameters
       These parameters are available from the `Custom...'  option
       on the `Type' menu.

       Width, Height
              Size of grid in squares.

       Shape type
              This  control  determines  the  shape  of the region
              which is flipped by clicking in  any  given  square.
              The  default setting, `Crosses', causes every square
              to flip itself and its four immediate neighbours (or
              three  or  two  if  it's  at an edge or corner). The
              other setting, `Random', causes a random shape to be
              chosen  for  every  square, so the game is different
              every time.
