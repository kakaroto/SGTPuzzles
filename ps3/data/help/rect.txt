Rectangles
       You have a grid of squares, with numbers written in some (but not  all)
       of  the  squares. Your task is to subdivide the grid into rectangles of
       various sizes, such that (a) every rectangle contains exactly one  num‐
       bered square, and (b) the area of each rectangle is equal to the number
       written in its numbered square.

       Credit for this game goes to the Japanese puzzle magazine  Nikoli  [3];
       I've  also seen a Palm implementation at Puzzle Palace [4]. Unlike Puz‐
       zle Palace's implementation, my version automatically generates  random
       grids  of  any size you like. The quality of puzzle design is therefore
       not quite as good as hand-crafted puzzles would be,  but  on  the  plus
       side  you  get  an inexhaustible supply of puzzles tailored to your own
       specification.

   Rectangles controls
       This game is played with the mouse or cursor keys.

       Left-click any edge to toggle it on or off, or left-click and  drag  to
       draw  an entire rectangle (or line) on the grid in one go (removing any
       existing edges within that rectangle). Right-clicking and dragging will
       allow  you  to  erase the contents of a rectangle without affecting its
       edges.

       Alternatively, use the cursor  keys  to  move  the  position  indicator
       around  the  board.  Pressing the return key then allows you to use the
       cursor keys to drag a rectangle out from that  position,  and  pressing
       the  return  key  again  completes  the  rectangle. Using the space bar
       instead of the return key allows you to erase the contents of a rectan‐
       gle without affecting its edges, as above.

       When a rectangle of the correct size is completed, it will be shaded.

       (All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.)

   Rectangles parameters
       These  parameters  are  available  from  the  `Custom...' option on the
       `Type' menu.

       Width, Height
              Size of grid, in squares.

       Expansion factor
              This is a mechanism for changing the type of grids generated  by
              the  program.  Some  people prefer a grid containing a few large
              rectangles to one containing many small ones.  So  you  can  ask
              Rectangles  to essentially generate a smaller grid than the size
              you specified, and then to expand it by adding rows and columns.

              The default expansion factor of zero means that Rectangles  will
              simply  generate  a grid of the size you ask for, and do nothing
              further. If you set an expansion factor of (say) 0.5,  it  means
              that  each  dimension of the grid will be expanded to half again
              as big after generation. In other words, the initial  grid  will
              be  2/3  the size in each dimension, and will be expanded to its
              full size without adding any more rectangles.

              Setting an expansion factor of around 0.5 tends to make the game
              more  difficult,  and  also  (in  my  experience) rewards a less
              deductive and more intuitive playing style. If you  set  it  too
              high,  though,  the  game simply cannot generate more than a few
              rectangles to cover the entire grid, and the game becomes  triv‐
              ial.

       Ensure unique solution
              Normally, Rectangles will make sure that the puzzles it presents
              have only one solution. Puzzles with ambiguous sections  can  be
              more  difficult and more subtle, so if you like you can turn off
              this feature and risk having ambiguous  puzzles.  Also,  finding
              all the possible solutions can be an additional challenge for an
              advanced player. Turning off this option can also speed up  puz‐
              zle generation.
