Singles
       You have a grid of white squares, all of which contain num‐
       bers. Your task is to colour  some  of  the  squares  black
       (removing the number) so as to satisfy all of the following
       conditions:

       ·      No number occurs more than once in any row  or  col‐
              umn.

       ·      No  black square is horizontally or vertically adja‐
              cent to any other black square.

       ·      The remaining white squares must all form  one  con‐
              tiguous  region (connected by edges, not just touch‐
              ing at corners).

   Singles controls
       Left-clicking on an empty  square  will  colour  it  black;
       left-clicking again will restore the number. Right-clicking
       will add a circle (useful for indicating  that  a  cell  is
       definitely not black).

       You  can  also use the cursor keys to move around the grid.
       Pressing the return or space keys will turn a square  black
       or  add  a  circle respectively, and pressing the key again
       will restore the number or remove the circle.

       able.)
