Singles
       You have a grid of white squares, all of which  contain  numbers.  Your
       task is to colour some of the squares black (removing the number) so as
       to satisfy all of the following conditions:

       ·      No number occurs more than once in any row or column.

       ·      No black square is horizontally or vertically  adjacent  to  any
              other black square.

       ·      The  remaining white squares must all form one contiguous region
              (connected by edges, not just touching at corners).

   Singles controls
       Left-clicking  on  an  empty square will colour it black; left-clicking
       again will restore the number. Right-clicking will add a circle (useful
       for indicating that a cell is definitely not black).

       You  can also use the cursor keys to move around the grid. Pressing the
       return or space keys will turn a square black or add a  circle  respec‐
       tively,  and  pressing  the key again will restore the number or remove
       the circle.

       (All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.)
