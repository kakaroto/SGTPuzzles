Netslide
       This  game combines the grid generation of Net (see chapter 3) with the
       movement of Sixteen (see chapter 6): you have a Net grid,  but  instead
       of  rotating tiles back into place you have to slide them into place by
       moving a whole row at a time.

       As in Sixteen, control is with the mouse or cursor  keys.  See  section
       6.1.

       The  available  game  parameters  have similar meanings to those in Net
       (see section 3.2) and Sixteen (see section 6.2).

       Netslide was contributed to this collection by Richard Boulton.
