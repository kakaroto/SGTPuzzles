Fifteen
       The old ones are the best: this is the good  old  `15-puz-
       zle'  with  sliding  tiles. You have a 4x4 square grid; 15
       squares contain  numbered  tiles,  and  the  sixteenth  is
       empty.  Your  move  is  to choose a tile next to the empty
       space, and slide it into the space. The aim is to  end  up
       with  the  tiles in numerical order, with the space in the
       bottom right (so that the top row reads  1,2,3,4  and  the
       bottom row reads 13,14,15,space).

   Fifteen controls
       This  game  can  be  controlled with the mouse or the key-
       board.

       A left-click with the mouse in the row or column  contain-
       ing  the  empty space will move as many tiles as necessary
       to move the space to the mouse pointer.

       The arrow keys will move a tile adjacent to the  space  in
       the  direction indicated (moving the space in the opposite
       direction).

       (All the actions described in section 2.1 are also  avail-
       able.)

   Fifteen parameters
       The  only options available from the `Custom...' option on
       the `Type' menu are Width  and  Height,  which  are  self-
       explanatory.  (Once  you've  changed  these,  it's  not  a
       `15-puzzle' any more, of course!)
