Filling
       You have a grid of squares, some of which contain digits, and the  rest
       of which are empty. Your job is to fill in digits in the empty squares,
       in such a way that each connected region of squares all containing  the
       same digit has an area equal to that digit.

       (`Connected  region',  for  the  purposes  of this game, does not count
       diagonally separated squares as adjacent.)

       For example, it follows that no square can contain a zero, and that two
       adjacent  squares  can  not  both  contain a one. No region has an area
       greater than 9 (because then its area would not be a single digit).

   Filling controls
       To play Filling, simply click the mouse in any empty  square  and  then
       type  a  digit  on  the  keyboard  to fill that square. By dragging the
       mouse, you can select multiple squares to fill with a single  keypress.
       If  you  make  a  mistake,  click the mouse in the incorrect square and
       press 0, Space, Backspace or Enter to clear it again (or use  the  Undo
       feature).

       You  can also move around the grid with the cursor keys; typing a digit
       will fill the square containing the cursor with that number, or  typing
       0,  Space, or Enter will clear it. You can also select multiple squares
       for numbering or clearing by using the  return  key,  before  typing  a
       digit to fill in the highlighted squares (as above).

       (All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.)

   Filling parameters
       Filling  allows  you to configure the number of rows and columns of the
       grid, through the `Type' menu.
