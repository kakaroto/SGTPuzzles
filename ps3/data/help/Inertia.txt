Inertia
       You are a small green ball sitting in a grid full  of  obstacles.  Your
       aim is to collect all the gems without running into any mines.

       You can move the ball in any orthogonal or diagonal direction. Once the
       ball starts moving, it will continue until something stops it.  A  wall
       directly  in  its path will stop it (but if it is moving diagonally, it
       will move through a diagonal gap between two other walls without  stop‐
       ping). Also, some of the squares are `stops'; when the ball moves on to
       a stop, it will stop moving no matter what direction it was  going  in.
       Gems do not stop the ball; it picks them up and keeps on going.

       Running into a mine is fatal. Even if you picked up the last gem in the
       same move which then hit a mine, the game will count you as dead rather
       than victorious.

       This  game was originally implemented for Windows by Ben Olmstead [11],
       who was kind enough to release his source code on request  so  that  it
       could be re-implemented for this collection.

   Inertia controls
       You  can move the ball in any of the eight directions using the numeric
       keypad. Alternatively, if you click the left mouse button on the  grid,
       the  ball  will  begin  a  move  in  the general direction of where you
       clicked.

       If you use the `Solve' function on this game, the program will  compute
       a  path  through  the  grid  which  collects all the remaining gems and
       returns to the current position. A hint arrow will appear on  the  ball
       indicating  the  direction  in  which  you should move to begin on this
       path. If you then move in that direction,  the  arrow  will  update  to
       indicate  the  next  direction on the path. You can also press Space to
       automatically move in the direction of the hint arrow. If you move in a
       different  direction  from  the one shown by the arrow, the hint arrows
       will stop appearing because you have strayed from  the  provided  path;
       you can then use `Solve' again to generate a new path if you want to.

       All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available. In partic‐
       ular, if you do run into a mine and die, you can use the Undo  function
       and resume playing from before the fatal move. The game will keep track
       of the number of times you have done this.

   Inertia parameters
       These parameters are available  from  the  `Custom...'  option  on  the
       `Type' menu.
