Cube
       This is another one I originally saw as a web game. This one was a Java
       game  [2],  by  Paul Scott. You have a grid of 16 squares, six of which
       are blue; on one square rests a cube. Your move is  to  use  the  arrow
       keys  to  roll the cube through 90 degrees so that it moves to an adja‐
       cent square. If you roll the cube on to a blue square, the blue  square
       is  picked  up  on one face of the cube; if you roll a blue face of the
       cube on to a non-blue square, the blueness is put down again. (In  gen‐
       eral,  whenever you roll the cube, the two faces that come into contact
       swap colours.) Your job is to get all six blue squares on  to  the  six
       faces  of  the cube at the same time. Count your moves and try to do it
       in as few as possible.

       Unlike the original Java game, my version has  an  additional  feature:
       once you've mastered the game with a cube rolling on a square grid, you
       can change to a triangular grid and roll any of a tetrahedron, an octa‐
       hedron or an icosahedron.

   Cube controls
       This game can be played with either the keyboard or the mouse.

       Left-clicking  anywhere  on  the  window  will  move the cube (or other
       solid) towards the mouse pointer.

       The arrow keys can also used to roll the cube on its square grid in the
       four cardinal directions. On the triangular grids, the mapping of arrow
       keys to directions is more approximate. Vertical movement is disallowed
       where  it  doesn't make sense. The four keys surrounding the arrow keys
       on the numeric keypad (`7', `9', `1', `3') can  be  used  for  diagonal
       movement.

       (All the actions described in section 2.1 are also available.)

   Cube parameters
       These  parameters  are  available  from  the  `Custom...' option on the
       `Type' menu.

       Type of solid
              Selects the solid to roll (and hence the  shape  of  the  grid):
              tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, or icosahedron.

       Width / top, Height / bottom
              On  a square grid, horizontal and vertical dimensions. On a tri‐
              angular grid, the number of triangles on the top and bottom rows
              respectively.
